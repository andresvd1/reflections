How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Help to find the differences bewteen the old version and the new version of code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could find easily a old code and remember what are you trying to write

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Cons could be the time spend in do the commit. Pros you only save what you consider necessary and when you consider necessary

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It's is because in a big project you change a lot of files, and when you want commit the project you need all the files to be commited

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can find how many files you had commited and what's the lines that had had changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Yes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to commit and update a project
